# My Portfolio Site (Next.js)

## Intro
In my journey of learning React I've learnt a lot since I created [my original portfolio site](https://github.com/c-kirkeby/portfolio-react/) nearly a year ago. This is going to be an upgrade on my original site with a new look and feel and I'm going to be ditching [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) in favour of custom styles. Part of it is that I want it to be a learning experience in creating a responsive site from scratch and the second part is that I find trying to use a CSS library with styled-components to be a little awkward because it introduces a lot of boilerplate.

### Plans
- Once the main layout is done, I will be trying to serve some content via the blog and portfolio and it will either be static content or done through a GraphQL API.
